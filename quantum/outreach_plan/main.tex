\section{Description for the demo}

We have built a 4 qubit prototype \textit{costing only \pounds10} and uses a rechargeable
battery. We use LEDs to show
the qubits and there are buttons for user input, we have also written some quantum
algorithms which you can run and see what happens to the qubits as it runs. We would like
to build a 16 qubit version, however we require more funds to pursue this.


\section{Part list}

We would expect it to cost between \pounds100 - \pounds300 in total.
