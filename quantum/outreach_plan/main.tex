\section{Description for the demo}

We have built a 4 qubit prototype \textit{costing only \pounds10} and uses a rechargeable battery. We use LEDs to show the qubits and there are buttons for user input, we have also written some quantum algorithms which you can run and see what happens to the qubits as it runs. We would like to build a 16 qubit version, however we require more funds to pursue this.

\section{Part list}

We would expect it to cost between \pounds100 - \pounds300 in total.

\subsection{Components}
\begin{itemize}
\item LEDs: £1 each, £16 in total for 16
\item Buttons: £1 each, £20 in total for 20 buttons (may need bigger buttons later for the final demo)
\item LED drivers: £0.72 each, £5.76 for 8 chips
\item Shift registers: £0.32, £1.60 for 5 chips
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PCB}

Under £100.
